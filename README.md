# N-Queen-Problem
If you don't already know the N Queen problem asks you to sort N queens on an NxN chess board without any queen threatening another queen. We stepped it up a notch and we decided to print ALL of the possible ways to sort the queens and also at the end we wrote how many possible combinations there are and how much time it took to print them. The source code is in our Github, feel free to download it and tinker with it a little bit.
You can find an EXE file in the debug folder if you don't want to mess with the code.
